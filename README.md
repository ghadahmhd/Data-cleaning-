# Data Cleaning 
A robust Python/Pandas workflow for cleaning the Global Video Game Sales dataset, focusing on missing data imputation and preparation for sales analysis.
 ##Global Video Game Sales Data Cleaning Project âœ¨
This repository contains a reproducible Python workflow focused on transforming the raw Kaggle Video Game Sales dataset into a clean, analysis-ready format. The accompanying Jupyter notebook (data cleaning.ipynb) demonstrates essential data quality checks and imputation techniques.

 Technologies Used
The analysis and cleaning process was performed using the following core Python libraries:

Pandas: Used for data loading, manipulation, cleaning, and preparation.

NumPy: Used for numerical operations.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Imported for potential exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization.

Plotly: Imported for interactive data visualization.

opendatasets: Used to easily download the data directly from Kaggle.
